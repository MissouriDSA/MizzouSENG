###Description###
This project utilizes an API from the Huffington Post that provides polling information
for primaries, elections, and various topics.  It focuses on the Democratic
candidates for the 2016 Presidential Election. When loaded, the app retrieves a list of 
the candidates and uses a data visualization library called D3.js to plot a bar
graph of each candidate's standing in the primaries.
