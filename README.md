**The Huffington Post: Poll Data and Candidate Standings**

  This project uses the API provided by the Huffington Post called Pollster. Pollster allows us 
to use information that the Huffington Post has gathered, for over ten years, on primaries, elections, 
and various other opinion topics. It also includes estimates on the current opinion on various topics
and canidates. This project retrieves a list of the GOP candidates and uses D3.js, a javascript library 
for data visualization, to create and display a bar graph representing each candidate's standing in 
the polls.
