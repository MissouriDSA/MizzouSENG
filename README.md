# Republican Party Primary Standings Application (ZOU SENG)

This project uses an API from the Huffington Post that provides pulling information for primaries, elections and various topics.
It focuses on the Republican (GOP) candidates for the 2016 presidental election. The application uses a data visualization library
called D3.js to plot a bar graph of each candidate's standing in the polls.
