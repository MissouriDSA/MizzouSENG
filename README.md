#GOP Candidate Standings for the 2016 Election

The purpose of this project application is to present information regarding polling statistics for 
a list of Republican (GOP) candidates. The information is displayed via a data visualization library
called D3.js, which shows a bar graph of each candidate's standing after the application loads.  

The polling information is taken from an API from the Huffington Post.
