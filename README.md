####CS 4320: Software Engineering SP 2016

This repository contains the implementation of a web application that graphs polling results for the 2016 U.S. presidential elections based on [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/) data . The application and the changes committed in the repository are intended to be a beginner's practical guide to git and GitHub. The application uses several tools like jQuery, D3.js, and the Huffington Post API. The links for each of these applications are included here:

* **jQuery:** https://jquery.com/
* **D3.js:** http://d3js.org/
* **Huffington Post API:** http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api
