####MizzouSENG exercise 1

This project utilizes three tools, the Huffington Post's Pollster API , D3.js, and JQuery to retrieve a list of the GOP candidates and democratic candidates and their current poll standings. 

The Huffingting Post's pollster API provides polling information for primaries, elections, and various topics.
D3.js is used for making data visualizations. jQuery makes ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

A visualization with bar graphs is produced using the poll data.
