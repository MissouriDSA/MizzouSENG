## THE ART OF BIG SOCIAL DATA

This project uses an API from the Huffington Post that provides polling information for primaries, elections, and various topics. It focuses on the Republican (GOP) candidates for the 2016 Presidential Election. When the application loads, it retrieves a list of the GOP candidates and uses a data visualization library called D3.js to plot a bar graph of each candidateâ€™s standing in the polls.

### Tools Used:
* [Huffington Post API] (http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api)
* [jQuery] (https://jquery.com)
* [D3.js] (d3js.org)
