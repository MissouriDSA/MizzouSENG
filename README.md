## My visualization
My visualization used the basic bar graph that was given, but with a couple of modifications. The first thing that was done was adding of the democratic results and displayed each party side by side with a CSS3 Flex box. I changed the colors of the bars, as well as used Javascript to shrink the result number to a decimal with 2 places so that the results would fit. 

## My visualization - cahpx3
Updated the colors to reflect on the Democratic party and added a Header.
