# MizzouSENG Exercise 1

This project uses the Huffington Post's API that has polling info 
for the primaries, elections, and various topics. 
Students were given code that retrieves a list of GOP candidates and 
uses D3.js to plot a bar graph of each of the candidate's standings in the polls.
The students' goal is to use the Huffington Post API to add the 2016 
Democratic Presidential candidates to the bar graph and plot the data using D3.js.
