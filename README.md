#GOP Candidates of the 2016 upcoming election

This project app is for presenting information surrounding the polling statistics for Republican (GOP) candidates. A data visualization library displays the information which shows bar graph of each candidate's standing once the D3.js application loads.

The polling information is taken from the Huffington Post API.
