Republican and Democratic Candidates Graphs

This project is for the software engineering class 4320 practicing how to use github repositories. The project consists of a simple
webpage that has graphs for the republican and democratic candidates for the 2016 presidential election. The graphs are all
generated using jQuery, D3.js, and the Huffington Post API.
