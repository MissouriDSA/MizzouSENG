# Electoral Candidate Information

This project uses an API from the Huffington Post that provides polling information for primaries, elections, and various topics. 
The focus on the project is on both the Democratic and Republican candidates for the 2016 Presedential election.

The documentation for the API is available here:

http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api

When the application loads, it retrieves a list of the GOP candidates and uses a data
visualization library called D3.js to plot a bar graph of each candidateâ€™s standing in the polls.

Jquery and its documentation can be found here:

D3.js is avaialable from:
