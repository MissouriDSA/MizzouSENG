# Pollster API

The Pollster API provides programmatic access to the results of tens of thousands of opinion polls we've collected since 2004 as well as our estimates of the current opinion on various candidates and topics.
This API is for developers who want to incorporate our data into their own applications. To embed a chart on your site or download poll results as a spreadsheet, follow the links below each chart.
