# CS 4320 Exercise 1

This project uses an API from the Huffington Post that provides polling information for primaries, elections, and various topics. It focuses on the Republican (GOP) candidates for the 2016 Presidential Election. The documentation for the API is available [here](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api).

### Functionality

When the application loads, it retrieves a list of the GOP and Democratic candidates and uses a data visualization library called D3.js to plot a bar graph of each candidate's standing in the polls.
