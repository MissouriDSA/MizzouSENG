## 2016 Presidential Poll Tracker

This project uses an API from the Huffington Post that provides polling information for
primaries, elections, and various topics. It focuses on the Republican (GOP) candidates for the
2016 Presidential Election.

When the application loads, it retrieves a list of the GOP candidates and uses a data
visualization library called D3.js to plot a bar graph of each candidate’s standing in the polls.

#### Tools used:
 * jQuery 1.12.0 http://jquery.com/download/
