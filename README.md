#Group 9 Project Title

##Description
This project is designed to familiarize ourselves with git and utilize it in a small group setting. This repo is for group 9, and is it forked from the class repository for the assignment. The goal is to use an API and a few javascript libraries to create a visualization for presidential candidate polls. Below are links to the tools.

###Visualizations

####Jared Welch
My visualization is a simple UI change to make the graphs more readable. First, I changed the data to represent the democratic presidential candidates, as outlined in the assignment description. Second, I changed the background color, font color, and bar colors in order to make them look more visually appealing. Finally, I adjusted the width of the labels for each bar in order to make the graph look more organized.
